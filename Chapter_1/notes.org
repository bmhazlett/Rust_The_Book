* How to compile the file here
** rustc main.rs

* How to run after compiling
** ./main

* Anatomy of a Rust Program
fn main() {
   println!("Hello, world!");
}
** fn main() {}
*** This is a *function* 
** println!("Hello, world");
*** This is a *macro*
*** "Hello, world"  is a String
* Cargo
** Cargo is the build system and package manager for Rust -> its super convienent
** It also manages the dependencies
** cargo --version
*** This will show the version
** cargo new <name_of_project>
*** This will create a directory with the following files
**** Cargo.toml
***** Contains package info and dependencies
**** src/main.rs
***** This is the main method which will contain hello world
** cargo build
*** This will build and create and executable
*** ./target/debug/<name_of_project>
** cargo run
*** This will execute the executable that was make in the build step
** cargo check
*** This will do a compiler check first
** Buidling for Release
*** cargo build --release
**** This makes an executable in the target/release directory 
**** It makes a more efficient program but takes longer to compile
